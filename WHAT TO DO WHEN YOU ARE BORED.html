</body>
</html>

<body>
There are many things we can do when we are in a pandemic
like this one, the COVID-19 virus has stopped us from many things but not some indoor activities!! . 
Many countries have a lock down or are in quarantine.We can make use of this time instead of wasting it.
As eveveryone says, "Time and tide waits for none". At the beginning of the quaratine, 
I was bored, so I searched up things we could do when we are bored and I found a ton of things.
I made a list of my own ideas and included some ideas from the internet so, if you are looking
for something fun to do, this is the right place to find out!
</body>
<p>These are my ideas:
<ul>
<li>Build a fort:This is a fun thing which everyone can do. Just grab some blankets and some pillows!!
</li>
<li>Clean your room:It might sound boring but you gotta do it at some point and bonus, you might find
 something you thought you lost a long time ago.</li>
<li>Do some exercise:You should have some physical exercise for atleast twice a week because not
exercising leads to obesity and other health problems so go, grab your mat and put on some
exercising clothes.</li>
<li>Make a project: Ugh, this is my personal favorite, there are many categories in this idea,
 I love making projects. Infact this website is a project. There are two categories, 
they are virtual and practical and the examples are listed below for each category
<p>
These are some examples I could think of but you could make things more interesting
</p>
<p>
VIRTUAL
</p>
<li>Make an app
<li>Design a website
<li>Create a game
<li>Enhance a website or an app
<p>
PRACTICAL
<ol>
<li>Make a comic
<li>A model of something
<li>Scrapbook
<li>Write a future letter to yourself and add it to a memory box

</li>
</ul>
<p>
</li>

<li>Learn a new language:Learing a new language improves your mental flexibility
and if you are still a school student like me, then when you grow up, it will be an 
advantage while trying to be employed. So go and make an account for duolingo!</li>
<li>Manicure or a pedicure;If you are a girl, then you could give yourself a manicure or a pedicure:Every girl's home
ha some nail polish and an electronic device, so search up some cool nail art and begin!</li>
<li>Spa:There are a lot of things people could be stressed about, legit everyone!So there is nothing 
better that giving yourself a spa bath!!There are many homemade spa recipes you could experiment!</li>
<li>Try a new recipe:Nobody can resist something sweet so try out new sweets which you didn't have time 
before quarantine.
<li>Take a walk outside:If the weather is sunny, then take a walk if you are allowed to, countries like Sweden, are not 
quarantined.I know that because I live in Sweden

<li>Try out new hairstyles:If you are a girly girl, then try out some new hairstyles like french 
and more!

<li>Learing an acro trick:This takes a lot of time and effort but boosts up a lot of confidence
which is needed in this time of our lives.
</li>

 <li>At home photoshoot: Hey, for you photography lovers out there, you can't take a photoshoot
 outside but can take it inside!!
</li>

<li>Solve the rubix cube: I used this idea a lot and now I know how to solve a rubix cube!  which takes time but 
can improve your logical skills

<li>Call a friend or a relative:Time could pass really fast when we talk to a friend but I DO NOT LIKE to timepass
so, I would recommed to do this for only a short period.

<li>Read a book: This sounds boring but when you start reading the book, then you can't stop if you find the 
right book.
</p>
